# Cursor Rules Guide

This document provides an overview of all available development rules and when to use them.

## 📋 Available Rules

### Core Development Rules

- **comment-rule**: Must read when writing code comments or documenting functions
- **development-workflow-rule**: Must read before starting any development task or code changes
- **git-commit-rule**: Must read before making any git commits or writing commit messages

### Specialized Domain Rules

- **database-development-rule**: Must read before making any database schema changes or migrations
- **i18n-development**: Must read when adding translation keys or working with i18n
- **debug**: Must read when debugging issues or investigating bugs

### Technical Integration Rules

- **cursor-rules**: Guidelines for writing and optimizing cursor rules themselves

## 🎯 When to Use Each Rule

### Before Starting Development
1. **development-workflow-rule** - Read this first for any coding task
2. **comment-rule** - When you need to document your code
3. **git-commit-rule** - Before making any commits

### Domain-Specific Tasks
- **Database changes** → **database-development-rule**
- **Translation work** → **i18n-development**
- **Bug investigation** → **debug**

### Rule Management
- **Writing new rules** → **cursor-rules**

## 🔧 How to Use Rules

1. **Automatic**: Some rules apply automatically based on file patterns
2. **Manual**: Use `@rule-name` to reference specific rules when needed
3. **Fetch**: Use the fetch_rules tool to get detailed rule content

## 📝 Best Practices

- Read the relevant rule before starting work in that domain
- Follow the guidelines strictly for consistency
- Update rules when patterns change
- Keep rules focused and actionable
